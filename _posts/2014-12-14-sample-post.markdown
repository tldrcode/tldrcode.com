write markdown here. For a reference to what that look like feel free to check
out this
[page](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

And that's how you put a link in Markdown. Below you can see how to use our
syntax highlighter.

<pre><code class="language-cpp">cout << "Here\'s the C++ syntax highlighting!"
cout << "Yay!"
</code></pre>
